Solution
Identified Bugs and Fixes
1. Payload Size Validation
Issue: The server did not validate payload sizes, risking buffer overflows or crashes.
Fix: Introduced a MAX_MESSAGE_SIZE constant to enforce payload limits. If exceeded, the server responds with a status code 2 and logs an error appropriatelyâ€‹â€‹.
2. Single-Threaded Server Design
Issue: The single-threaded architecture blocked new connections while processing existing ones, reducing scalability.
Fix: Migrated to a multithreaded server architecture. Each client connection now spawns a dedicated thread, enabling concurrent handling of requestsâ€‹â€‹.
3. Malformed Payload Handling
Issue: Receiving corrupted or malformed data caused the server to fail unexpectedly.
Fix: Implemented robust error handling for malformed payloads, ensuring the server logs the error and responds gracefully to the clientâ€‹â€‹.
4. Unclear Protocol for Shutdown
Issue: Clients were abruptly disconnected during server shutdown, causing potential data loss.
Fix: Implemented a graceful shutdown mechanism where the server informs clients of impending disconnection, allowing them to handle it cleanlyâ€‹â€‹.
5. Inefficient Logging
Issue: Lack of clear logging levels (debug, info, warn, error) made debugging difficult.
Fix: Enhanced logging clarity by categorizing logs using the log crate and added contextual information for critical eventsâ€‹â€‹.

Design Improvements

1. Thread-Safe Server
Enhancement: Introduced thread safety using Arc<AtomicBool> to coordinate server state across threads. This ensures consistent behavior in the multithreaded environmentâ€‹â€‹.
2. Client API Enhancements
Enhancement: Improved the client-server communication protocol to support structured messages like EchoMessage and AddRequest, allowing better protocol clarity and extensibilityâ€‹â€‹.
3. Connection Throttling
Enhancement: Implemented connection throttling to limit resource usage during bursts of traffic. Added server-side logic to enforce a maximum connection limit and reject excess clients gracefullyâ€‹â€‹.
5. Protocol Error Handling
Enhancement: Improved error responses for invalid or unsupported requests, providing better debugging insights to clientsâ€‹â€‹.

Testing and Validation

1. Functional Tests
Verified core functionalities:
Successful client connections and disconnections.
Proper echoing of client messages.
Validation and rejection of oversized payloadsâ€‹â€‹.
2. Performance Tests
Successfully handled 100 concurrent client connections without errors or resource contentionâ€‹â€‹.
3. Stress and Boundary Testing
Malformed payloads were rejected gracefully.
Connection requests exceeding the max_connections limit were throttled and loggedâ€‹â€‹.
4. Concurrent Request Handling
Ensured no race conditions under concurrent request scenarios.
Verified thread-safe processing of multiple clientsâ€‹â€‹.
5. Throttling Validation
Tested server throttling behavior under high load, ensuring only the allowed number of connections proceeded while others were rejectedâ€‹.

Summary
This solution effectively transitions the server from a single-threaded, error-prone design to a robust, multithreaded architecture with enhanced features:

Thread safety ensures reliable operation under concurrent loads.
Rate limiting and throttling protect against resource exhaustion.
Graceful error handling improves resilience against malformed requests and oversized payloads.
Comprehensive testing guarantees stability, scalability, and adherence to functional requirements.
These improvements provide a scalable and maintainable solution ready for real-world use. ðŸš€
